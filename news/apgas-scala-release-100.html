<h3>APGAS for Scala Released</h3>

We are happy to announce the release of the <a href="https://github.com/x10-lang/apgas-scala">APGAS library for Scala</a>.

This library provides an implementation of X10's Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space (APGAS) programming model for resilient, elastic, parallel, and distributed programming as an embedded domain-specific language for Scala.  It is based on the <a href="http://x10-lang.org/software/download-apgas/latest-apgas-release.html">APGAS library for Java</a>.
