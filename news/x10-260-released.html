<h3>X10 2.6.0 Released</h3>
<p>We are happy to announce the release of X10 and X10DT 2.6.0.  The
   main features of this release are language extensions to enhance
   support for defining embedded DSLs in X10.  In particular, an
   overloading mechanism for redefining or extending the behavior of
   control structures was added to X10 and X10 now supports a
  lightweight trailing closure syntax.
  
  The release is available for download at <a href="/releases/x10-release-260">http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-260</a>.</p>
