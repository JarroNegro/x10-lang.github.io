<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">The concurrency and scale-out era is upon us. Application
programmers need to confront the architectural challenge of
multiples cores and accelerators, clusters and supercomputers. A
central need is the development of a usable programming model
that can address these challenges -- dealing with thousands of
cores and peta-bytes of data.</p>
<p align="justify">The open-source <a href="http://x10-lang.org/">X10 programming language</a> is designed to address
these twin challenges of productivity and performance. It is
organized around four basic principles of asynchrony, locality,
atomicity and order, developed on a type-safe, class-based,
object-oriented foundation.  This foundation is robust enough to
support fine-grained concurrency, Cilk-style fork-join
programming, active messaging, hierarchical and elastic
resources, as well as application-level resilience.  X10
implementations are available on a wide range of systems ranging
from laptops, to clusters, to supercomputers.</p>
<p align="justify">The X10 Workshop is intended as a forum for X10 programmers,
developers, researchers, and educators. We anticipate the program
of the workshop to combine keynotes and presentations of selected
papers with ample time for discussions. We are soliciting both
short papers (4-6 pages) and extended talk abstracts (2
pages). We encourage submissions on all aspects of X10, including
theory, design, implementation, practice, curriculum development
and experience, applications and tools. This will be a full day
workshop.</p>
<h3>Important Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abstracts</strong>: Friday, March 11, 2016 (Anywhere on Earth)</li>
<li><strong>Submissions</strong>: Sunday, March 20, 2016 (Anywhere on Earth)</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>: Friday, April 15, 2016</li>
<li><strong>Final version</strong>: Friday, April 29, 2016</li>
<li><strong>Workshop</strong>: Tuesday, June 14, 2016</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p align="justify"><strong>Submission site will be available shortly.</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> Submissions should present original research. Submissions may be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short paper: four to six pages in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings style (9-point type, all inclusive),</li>
<li>Extended abstract: two pages in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings style (9-point type, all inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Submissions must be in PDF and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.</p>
<p align="justify">All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. During the workshop, extended abstracts will receive a shorter presentation and discussion period.</p>
<p align="justify">Accepted papers will be hosted on the X10 website. Accepted authors will have the option of having their paper in the proceedings that will be published by the ACM up to two weeks before the meeting.</p>
