<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">In this project, we aim to design efficient dynamic programming algorithms (DP) in X10 on modern multi-core processors and distributed systems. At the same time, we will compare these algorithms in X10 to the same algorithms in other languages, in order to quantify the performance differences between X10 and other languages. In detail, we will first use X10 and use existing languages such as C++, Pthread and MPI to design efficient implementations of parallel DP algorithms. All implementations are aimed to efficiently utilize all levels of parallelism on modern multi-core processors and distributed systems, including instruction pipelines, SIMD capability, multiple cores, memory-level parallelism, multiple nodes, etc. Second, we will compare the implementations in X10 to the implementations in other languages, in order to quantify the differences between X10 and other languages in terms of performance. Third, we will try to propose and design some programming tools for bioinformatics in X10, such as efficient task scheduling between multiple cores and multiple nodes.</span></p>
