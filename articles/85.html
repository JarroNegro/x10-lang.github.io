<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chandra Krintz, UC Santa Barbara (X10 team contact: Steve Fink)</span></em></span><br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">We will integrate X10 into AppScale &ndash; an open-source emulation of the PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) cloud APIs of Google App Engine. This will include integrating X10 (a) as a front-end development language (an alternative to Python and Java) that facilitates easy development of parallel and distributed applications as user-facing computations that work well in the cloud; (b) as a Tasks API language which will facilitate type-safe, parallel programming of web applications and services for efficient and scalable background computing; (c) as a language users employ for writing their own mappers and reducers, as well as the language for implementation of MapReduce in the AppScale Backend; and (d) as the implementation language for the parallel and concurrent activities within AppScale itself (for MapReduce, request handling, data processing, and other services within the AppScale control center). We also will extend the AppScale debugging and testing system with support for X10; and we will extend scheduling support in AppScale to handle execution of X10 tasks in parallel in support of the front end web service (in addition to scheduling other tasks, MapReduce jobs, internal components, database replicas, and front-end instances). As part of these pursuits, we will investigate application-specific compiler and runtime optimizations for performance, efficiency, and scaling, scheduling and load balancing techniques across both single and multiple machines.</span></p>
