<p>We have migrated the JIRA used for X10 project issue tracking to a new location: <a href="https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/projects/XTENLANG">https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/projects/XTENLANG</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Userids were migrated from the old JIRA at Codehaus to the new one, but for security reasons passwords were not migrated.&nbsp; If you had a userid in the old JIRA, please use the password reset mechanism to set a password in the new X10 JIRA instance.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, please contact David Grove (groved@us.ibm.com) to make sure your userid is associated with the correct email account to enable the password reset to work.</p>
