<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">Dr. Reiss will teach the course Programming Parallel and Distributed Systems course using X10 as a unifying language. The course covers a range of topics, including lightweight threads on multi-core machines, large-scale distribution on clouds, and high-performance parallel computing on supercomputers. X10 will serve as a common language for the course, as it is designed to work well in all these domains. Students will get experience programming multi-core, distributed systems, and supercomputer platforms and will look at real applications in each of these domains.</span></p>
