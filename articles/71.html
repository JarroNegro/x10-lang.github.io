<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">This project aims to research and improve data clustering algorithms, which will be developed as application program class libraries using X10. Class libraries developed in X10 are to be divided into two types, one is for classical clustering algorithms, and the other is for clustering algorithms improved by ourselves. Each class library can be discriminated and refined according to the data object to be processed, such as spatial or time-series data, stream data and graph data, etc. To verify the practicability, scalability, robustness and performance of equivalent algorithms from different class libraries, data from different fields, such as </span><st1:stockticker>GIS</st1:stockticker><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">, medicine, bioinformatics etc, need to be considered consistently.</span></p>
