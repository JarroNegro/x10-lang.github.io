<p><strong>Keynote Title:&nbsp; </strong>Constrained types: What are they and what can they do for you</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: </strong>Vijay <span>Saraswat</span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br /> <br /> One of the major innovations of the X10 programming language is constrained types [OOPSLA 2008]. A constrained type is of the form N{c} where N is the name of a class/struct/interface and c is a constraint on the properties (marked immutable instance fields) of N. Constraints may reference any accessible immutable variable and may be drawn from any vocabulary of predicates, as long as an underlying constraint solver is available.<br /> <br /> For instance, an object o is of type Matrix{self.I==self.J} if it is of type Matrix and o.I==o.J. The signature of matrix multiply can be given by def mult(a:Matrix{self.I==this.J}):Matrix{self.I==this.I, self.J==a.J}. If the class Tree is augmented with a property root:Tree, then the type Tree{self.root=o} is precisely the type of all nodes in the tree with root o (cf membership in ownership domains).<br /> <br /> Constrained types may occur wherever types can occur -- including in declarations of variables, fields and parameters, return types of methods, dynamic casts, annotations etc. The X10 compiler statically checks symbolic entailment of constraints when performing subtype checks (e.g. to determine if an expression can be assigned to a variable, or returned from a method).<br /> <br /> Constrained types are a particularly powerful form of dependent types well-suited to object-oriented programming languages. They draw power from the natural impredicativity of object-oriented languages -- the type of any field of a class T can be T or any class which has fields of type T. Indeed,&nbsp; checking entailment of constrained types even with just == and != constraints is undecidable (because of impredicativity).<br /> <br /> Constrained types are very valuable in code generation and array bounds checking. For instance, the type Array[T] in X10 can be defined over arbitrarily shaped index regions. The type Rail[T] is defined as Array[T]{self.rank==1,self.zeroBased,self.rect}, i.e. the set of all arrays o of type T such that o's region is 0..N for some N. If the compiler infers that a variable is of type Rail[T] it generates much more efficient code for accessing its elements.&nbsp; Similarly, if x:Array{self.region==r}, and p:Point(r.inner(1)) (where r.inner(k) represents all those points p such that p+k lies in r), then x(p) and x(p+1) can be statically established to be legal accesses (without knowing the value of r) since p and p+1 lie in r. (*)<br /> <br /> Constrained types can also be used for safety analysis of concurrent programs, in particular for establishing that two pieces of parallel code affect disjoint partitions of the heap (= zones), and hence can commute with each other. In particular we show how the "region effects" of Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) can be naturally represented in X10 using constrained types. For instance the type of all arrays x of type T whose members x(p) lie in the zone Zone(x.zone,p)&nbsp; obtained from x.zone using the index p can be described by x#Array[(p:x.region)=&gt; T{self.zone==Zone(x.zone,p)}].&nbsp; Using this the compiler can establish that if p!= q and p,q lie in x.region then x(p) != x(q). (*)<br /> <br /> (*) These constraints cannot be processed by the X10 2.2 compiler. Work is in progress to add support for such constraints.</p>

<p>The concurrency era is here.<br /> <br /> Finally.<br /> <br /> The only way for software to continue to ride Moore's law is to go parallel and scale out. But how? For most application programmers, the prospect of having to deal with low-level concurrent programming in MPI, OpenMP or CUDA is unappetizing at best.<br /> <br /> In 2004 we started the (open-source) X10 programming language project at IBM Research with funding from DARPA to address performance and productivity at scale. X10 is a strongly typed, imperative, object-oriented language in the tradition of Java, with a very few orthogonal constructs for fine-grained concurrency and distribution (places, asychnrony, termination detection, atomicity). X10 offers a single, high-level, programming model subsuming MPI (multi-node execution across a cluster), OpenMP (shared memory concurrency within a node) and CUDA (essentially vectorization within a GPU), while offering rich semantic guarantees.<br /> <br /> Programs in a large fragment of the language are guaranteed to be safe, that is, equivalent to the underlying sequential program (hence deadlock-free and determinate).<br /> <br /> X10 can be compiled to run on JVMs (inter-operating with Java) or natively, and runs on top of Ethernet or Infiniband, via sockets, MPI and more modern one-sided messaging systems.<br /> <br /> The talk presents an overview of the X10 programming language, the underlying APGAS programming model, and its implementation.

<p><strong>Title: </strong>writing parallel constraint solvers, simply</p>
<p><strong>Speaker: </strong>Vijay <span><span>Saraswat</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The concurrency era is here.<br /> <br /> Finally.<br /> <br /> The only way for software to continue to ride Moore's law is to go<br /> parallel and scale out. But how? For the expert in SAT or mixed<br /> integer programming, the prospect of having to deal with low-level<br /> concurrent programming in <span>MPI</span>, <span>OpenMP</span> or <span>CUDA</span> is unappetizing at best.<br /> <br /> In 2004 we started the <span>X10</span> programming language project at IBM<br /> Research with funding from <span>DARPA</span> to address performance and<br /> productivity at scale. <span>X10</span> is a strongly typed, imperative,<br /> object-oriented language in the tradition of Java, with a very few<br /> orthogonal constructs for fine-grained concurrency and distribution<br /> (places, <span>asychnrony</span>, termination detection, <span>atomicity</span>). <span>X10</span> offers a<br /> single, high-level, programming model subsuming <span>MPI</span> (multi-node<br /> execution across a cluster), <span>OpenMP</span> (shared memory concurrency within<br /> a node) and <span>CUDA</span> (essentially <span>vectorization</span> within a <span>GPU</span>), while<br /> offering rich semantic guarantees. Programs in a large fragment of the<br /> language are guaranteed to be deadlock-free and determinate.<br /> <br /> <span>X10</span> can be compiled to run on <span>JVMs</span> (inter-operating with Java) or<br /> natively, and runs on top of sockets, <span>MPI</span> and more modern one-sided<br /> messaging systems.<br /> <br /> In this talk we show how parallel constraint solvers can be written<br /> simply and elegantly in <span>X10</span>. With a few dozen lines of <span>X10</span> code it is<br /> possible to run in parallel multiple existing sequential constraint<br /> solvers (written in Java or C/C++, <span>e.g</span>. <span>MiniSat</span>), in such a way that<br /> they can communicate constraints to each other. We discuss the "global<br /> load balancing" framework (written in a few hundred lines of <span>X10</span>) that<br /> permits (<span>relocatable</span>) user tasks to be efficiently load balanced<br /> across a cluster, using a new technique, life-line based<br /> work-stealing. In <span>PPoPP</span> 2011 we presented best known efficiency<br /> numbers for the unbalanced tree search problem using these ideas. We<br /> believe such support makes <span>X10</span> ideal for experimenting with parallel<br /> portfolio-based solvers in various domains such as SAT or mixed<br /> integer programming.<br /> <br /> Work on parallel <span>MiniSat</span> was done with Dave Cunningham, IBM.</p>
