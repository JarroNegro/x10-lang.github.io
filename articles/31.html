<p>X10 is especially good at distributing your application over a cluster of distributed memory machines. In particular, with X10, there is a natural migration path from a single-threaded prototype, to a version that uses multiple cores on an SMP, to a distributed memory implementation that runs across a cluster of SMPs.</p>
