<p>X10 is a new programming language being developed at IBM Research in collaboration with academic partners and the open source community. X10 is a type-safe, parallel object-oriented language. It targets parallel systems with multi-core SMP nodes interconnected in scalable cluster configurations. A member of the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) family of languages, X10 allows the programmer to explicitly manage locality via <tt>Places</tt>. lightweight activities embodied in <tt>async</tt>, constructs for termination detection ( <tt>finish</tt>) and phased computation ( <tt>clocks</tt>), and the manipulation of global arrays and data structures.</p><p>X10DT is an Eclipse-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with functionality for viewing, editing, navigating, executing, and manipulating X10 programs.</p><p>The X10 effort at IBM is part of the IBM PERCS project (Productive Easy-to-use Reliable Computer Systems) in the DARPA program on High Productivity Computer Systems.</p>
