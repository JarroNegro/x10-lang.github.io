This course consists of curricular development activities in the area of parallel programming based on the X10 programming language. In this course, graduate students will learn new programming skills that will be useful for programming multi-core or cluster computers. The course will be about methods and applications of parallel computing and parallel programming languages. Dr. Shaohua Liu will give three fourths of the lectures, and the participants will give the remainder. This course could help the students start their new research work in this emerging area, and then cause a &quot;snowball effect&quot; in their future research team, work group and networking communities.</span></p>
