<p>The genesis of the X10 project was the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program. As such, X10 is intended to be a programming language that achieves &amp;ldquo;Performance and Productivity at Scale.&amp;rdquo; The primary hardware platforms being targeted by the language are clusters of multi-core processors linked together into a large scale system via a high-performance network. Therefore, supporting both concurrency and distribution are first class concerns of the program language design. The language must also support the development and use of reusable application frameworks to increase programmer productivity; this requirement motivates the inclusion of a sophisticated generic type system, closures, and object-oriented language features. Finally, like any new language, to gain acceptance X10 must be able to smoothly interoperate with existing libraries written in other languages.&amp;nbsp; This last requirement constrains both the design and the implementation of X10 in various ways</p>
