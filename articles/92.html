The &quot;logic&quot; in traditional logic </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">programming is a minimal first-order logic, but the logic underlying </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">L10 is a richer logic in which every fact or deduction has an </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">intrinsic notion of location. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">A logic with locations is significant because it gives a logical </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">justification for the use of (locally) stratified negation. In L10, we </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">are also interested in exploring the use of location to express </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">parallelism in a logic programming language by flexibly mapping </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">locations in L10 to places in X10, a parallel programming language </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 12pt;">being developed by IBM Research.</span><br />
