<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: times new roman,times;">If you are interested in contributing to the development of the X10 compiler and tools or if you encounter anomalies while using X10, you will be interested in exploring&nbsp;<a title="Jira Feature &amp; Bug Tracking for X10" href="https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/projects/XTENLANG">Jira</a>, which we use for our issue and feature tracking. You can use it to submit bug reports, browse the existing tickets, and request new features and enhancements. You can also vote for tickets that you consider urgent, and exchange opinions with other X10 users about open issues.</span></p>
