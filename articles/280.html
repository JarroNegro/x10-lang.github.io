<h3>X10 2.5.3 Released</h3>
<p>We are happy to announce the release of X10 and X10DT 2.5.3. The primary features in this release are improved compiler support for X10DT features. The X10 Editor is now much more resilient to syntax errors: features such as outline, hyperlink, hover help, and content-assist continue to work in the face of compilation errors.&nbsp; The release is available for download at <a href="releases/x10-release-253">http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-253</a>.</p>
