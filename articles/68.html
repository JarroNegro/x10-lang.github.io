<p>Prof. Nagaraja is engaged in research into P2P botnets made famous yet<br />again by post-wikileaks network attacks. His group seeks to understand<br />the fundamental limits of the P2P technologies used as botnet<br />foundations and design effective botnet countermeasures. The IBM X10<br />award will continue to fund research in this direction. The<br />understanding of efficiency, robustness and resilience to attacks of<br />various decentralised botnet architectures along with development of<br />novel techniques that will deal with the sea of uncertainty that comes<br />from building a system out of unreliable and sometimes untrustworthy<br />components will be game changing initiatives in dealing with the<br />problem of botnet defense. A significant component of this work is<br />large-scale statistical traffic analysis dealing with terabytes of<br />traffic on a daily basis. The IBM X10 award will fund a specific part<br />of his group's research agenda on developing concurrent techniques for<br />performing such analysis on ISP scale traffic. Specifically, on<br />spatial and temporal communication pattern analysis and understanding<br />botnet structure. The development of such highly concurrent large<br />scale systems will play a key role in engendering cooperative<br />cooperative detection of botnets in the near future.<br /><br />link: http://iiitd.edu.in/~nagaraja/</p>
