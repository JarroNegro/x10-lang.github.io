<p>The simplest way to start out with X10 is by using X10DT and Managed X10 (X10 compiled to Java).&nbsp; X10DT is an integrated development environment based on Eclipse and gives you an X10-aware editor, and integrated compile/execute/debug capabilities.&nbsp; You can <a href="software/download-x10/latest-release.html">download X10 with X10DT</a> as a single zip file that contains everything you need to write, compile, and run your first X10 program on your laptop/desktop.&nbsp; The X10 distribution also includes a <a href="https://svn.code.sourceforge.net/p/x10/code/x10dt/trunk/x10dt.help/html/samples/">set of small sample X10 programs</a> to get you started using the language.</p>
<p>If a binary distribution is not available for your system, or if you would like to use some of the extended features of <span>X10</span> (such as running on top of <span>MPI</span>, or compiling X10 programs to execute on GPGPUs), then you will need to <a href="x10-development/building-x10-from-source.html"><span>build X10</span> from source</a>.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Once you have X10 or X10DT installed, there are a variety of resources available to you on this site including the <a href="http://x10.sourceforge.net/documentation/languagespec/x10-latest.pdf">language specification</a>, <a href="documentation/tutorials.html">tutorials</a> and <a href="documentation/practical-x10-programming/performance-tuning.html">performance tuning tips</a> to help you become productive in using X10.</p>
