<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">The concurrency and scale-out era is upon us. Application programmers need to confront the architectural challenge of multiples cores and accelerators, clusters and supercomputers. A central need is the development of a usable programming model that can address these challenges -- dealing with thousands of cores and peta-bytes of data.</p>
<p align="justify">The open-source <a>X10 programming language</a> is designed to address these twin challenges of productivity and performance. It is organized around four basic principles of asynchrony, locality, atomicity and order, developed on a type-safe, class-based, object-oriented foundation. This foundation is robust enough to support fine-grained concurrency, Cilk-style fork-join programming, GPU programming, SPMD computations, active messaging, MPI-style communicators and cluster programming. X10 implementations are available on a wide range of systems ranging from laptops, to clusters, to supercomputers.</p>
<p align="justify">The X10 Workshop is intended as a forum for X10 programmers, developers, researchers, and educators. We anticipate the program of the workshop to combine keynotes and presentations of selected papers with ample time for discussions. We are soliciting both short papers (4-6 pages) and extended talk abstracts (2 pages). We encourage submissions on all aspects of X10, including theory, design, implementation, practice, curriculum development and experience, applications and tools. This will be a full day workshop.</p>
<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<li><strong>Abstracts</strong>: Friday, March 14th, 2014 (Anywhere on Earth)</li>
<li><strong>Submissions</strong>: Friday, March 21st, 2014 (Anywhere on Earth)</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>: Friday, April 18th, 2014</li>
<li><strong>Final version</strong>: Friday, May 16th, 2014</li>
<li><strong>Workshop</strong>: Thursday, June 12th, 2014</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p align="justify"><strong>Papers can now be submitted at: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=x102014">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=x102014</a>.</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Submissions may be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short paper: four to six pages in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings style (9-point type, all inclusive),</li>
<li>Extended abstract: two pages in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings style (9-point type, all inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Submissions must be in PDF and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.</p>
<p align="justify">All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. During the workshop, extended abstracts will receive a shorter presentation and discussion period.</p>
<p align="justify">To encourage the presentation and discussion of on-going work and preliminary results that can subsequently be published as full conference papers, we will not publish papers from the workshop. The revised short papers and extended abstracts from the presenters will be available to the workshop participants and others through the workshop website.</p>
