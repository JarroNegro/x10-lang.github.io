<h2>SatX10: A Scalable Plug &amp; Play Parallel Solver</h2>
<p>SatX10 is a framework for SAT researchers to conveniently try out new ideas in the context of parallel SAT solving without the burden of dealing with all the underlying system issues that arise when implementing a massively parallel algorithm. The framework is written in the X10 language, and allows the parallel solver to easily run on both a single machine with multiple cores and across multiple machines, sharing information such as learned clauses.</p>
<p>SatX10 is also a good example of using X10 to coordinate the communication of existing non-X10 programs.</p>
