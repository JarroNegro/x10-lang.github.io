<p><strong>X10 won the HPC Challenge "Best Performance" Award in the Class II competition at SC'12</strong>. The X10 submission (<a href="http://x10.sourceforge.net/documentation/hpcc/x10-hpcc2012-paper.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="http://x10.sourceforge.net/documentation/hpcc/x10-hpcc2012-slides.pdf">presentation</a>, <a href="http://x10.sourceforge.net/documentation/hpcc/x10-hpcc2012-code.zip">code</a>) was based on X10 code for Global HPL, Global Random Access and Global FFT and Unbalanced Tree Search (UTS) benchmarks and performance runs on the PERCS machine. All benchmarks were run at 32K cores, some also at 55K cores. We showed good scaling and good to outstanding absolute performance on all benchmarks.
