<p>X10 is a strongly typed, concurrent, imperative, object-oriented programming language designed for productivity and performance on modern multi-core and clustered architectures. X10 augments the familiar class-based object-oriented programming model with constructs to support execution across multiple address spaces, including constructs for a global object model, asynchrony and atomicity.</p>
