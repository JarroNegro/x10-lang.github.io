<p>We're very excited to announce that X10 and X10DT 2.4.0 are now available for download at <a href="http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-240" rel="nofollow">http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-240</a>.</p>
<p>X10 v2.4 is a major revision of the X10 programming language that significantly improves the ability of the X10 programmer to exploit the expanded memory capabilities of modern computer systems. In particular, X10 v2.4 includes an extensive redesign of arrays and a change of the default type of unqualified integral literals (e.g. 2) from Int to Long. Taken together these two changes enable natural exploitation of large memories via 64-bit addressing and Long-based indexing of arrays and similar data structures.</p>
