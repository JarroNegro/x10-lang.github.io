/**
 * Simple implementation of a directed graph and breadth-first search. An
 * undirected graph is simply a directed graph for which, whenever there is
 * an edge from v2 to v1, there is also one from v1 to v2.  For such graphs,
 * we wind up keeping twice as much data around as we really need, but there
 * does not seem to be a simple way to avoid it in view of how we need to
 * access the data.
 * 
 * Another thing to keep in mind is that we are really thinking in terms of
 * sparse graphs, by which we mean graphs whose mean number of edges per
 * vertex is small compared to the number of vertices.  Were the graph not
 * sparse--that is, were it dense--we would use an entirely different
 * representation, namely the graph&amp;#39;s full adjacency matrix.
 * 
 * The goal is computing maximal spanning trees for UNDIRECTED graphs.
 * The problem is not a lot harder for directed graphs, but involves enough
 * more code that it will distract from the points we want to make here:
 * the use of interfaces to achieve generic methods, and the use of &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot;
 * at a point long distant from the code that spawns the various threads.
